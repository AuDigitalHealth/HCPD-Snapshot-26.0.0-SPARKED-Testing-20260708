### Visibility and Suppression
The HCPD HealthcareService profile supports the [Suppressed](StructureDefinition-suppressed.html) extension, however its application is conceptually driven by organizational visibility decisions. When an [HCPD Organization](StructureDefinition-hcpd-organization.html) elects to hide their visibility from those searching the Health Connect Provider Directory system by applying the suppressed extension with an `organisation-initiated` code, all associated HealthcareService resources are automatically suppressed and excluded from Provider Directory listings. This cascading suppression ensures that when an organization chooses to hide their visibility, related healthcare services "come for the ride" and are similarly hidden from display, maintaining consistency across the directory.

### Identifiers
Beyond the identifiers already defined in AU Core the HCPD HealthcareService profile explicitly supports the following identifier slice (as indicated by the must support flag):

* [HCPD Local Identifier (hcpd-LI)](StructureDefinition-hcpd-local-identifier.html)

Unique identifier attributed by the HCPD system. 

### Usage notes
The `extension:iar-levels-of-care` is used to indicate the Initial Assessment and Referral (IAR) Levels of Care for a healthcare services that support mental health care. This extension draws its codes from the [Initial Assessment and Referral Levels of Care](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/iar-levels-of-care-1) ValueSet. 

#### Accept new patient
CodeableConcept datatype that indicates whether the healthcare service is accepting new patients.

#### Organization reference
The *providedBy* element must contain a relative reference to an existing [HCPD Organization](StructureDefinition-hcpd-organization.html).

#### Service provision code

This section describes the use of codes to indicate payment and billing options, helping requesters or searchers make informed decisions when seeking healthcare services.

#### Service type
Utilises the Service Type ValueSet, to draw codes from SNOMED that define concepts for the type of service that the healthcare service provides.

A single code representing the primary service type MUST be provided and selected from the [Service Type value set](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/service-type-1). 
    
#### Location reference
The *location* element must contain a relative reference to an existing [HCPD Location](StructureDefinition-hcpd-location.html) whose *managingOrganization* references a [HCPD Organization](StructureDefinition-hcpd-organization.html).

#### Availability
To indicate the healthcare service is not available during a period of time, use *notAvailable*. 

#### Coverage area
The coverage area that a service is intended for/available to should be defined using one or more instances of the *coverageArea* element, with the *address* elements of the contained ```Location``` populated depending on the type of coverage area to be defined. Health Connect currently supports coverage areas to be defined as Australia-wide (in which case only one *coverageArea* element should be present), or as a combination of individual states and/or suburbs (with separate *coverageArea* elements for each). See the [HCPD Service Coverage Area](StructureDefinition-hcpd-service-coverage-area.html) profile for more information.

#### Referral information
Some subscribing systems may render markdown contained in the [Referral Information For Referrer](StructureDefinition-referral-information-for-referrer.html) element; however this is not guaranteed, so publishing systems should limit markdown syntax in these elements to that which still renders well as plain text (such as bullets, numbered lists, or bold/italic text).
